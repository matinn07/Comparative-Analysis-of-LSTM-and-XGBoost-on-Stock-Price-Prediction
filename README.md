## 🔍 Problem Statement

Stock price prediction is challenging due to:
- High volatility
- Non-linear trends
- Long-term dependencies in time-series data

This project aims to:
- Predict stock prices using historical data
- Compare XGBoost and LSTM models
- Identify the most effective approach for time-series forecasting

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights (Resume-Ready)

- Analyzed **~3 years of Infosys stock data**
- Implemented **XGBoost Regression** and **LSTM Neural Network**
- Achieved **R² score of 0.91 using LSTM**
- Evaluated model performance using **MSE and R²**
- Forecasted **next 7 trading days**
- Visualized **actual vs predicted prices**
- Conducted detailed comparison of both models
